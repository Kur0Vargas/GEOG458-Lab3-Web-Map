# COVID County Visualizer

## Overview
**COVID County Visualizer** is an interactive web mapping lab that visualizes county-level COVID-19 data in the United States. The project includes two main maps. A choropleth map showing COVID-19 rates per 1,000 residents and a centroid map displaying the number of cases per county. The maps showcase a spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases across the country.

## Primary Functions
- **Choropleth Map**
  - Highlights counties based on COVID-19 rate tiers
  - Displays a hover tooltip showing the county name, state, and rate per 1,000 residents
  - Color gradient from white to deep red for visual clarity

- **Centroid Map**
  - Circle markers at counties, size and color scale off cases
  - Clicking on a marker displays a popup with the total cases in that county
  - Complimentary to the first map
